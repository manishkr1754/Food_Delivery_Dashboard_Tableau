## Problem Statement
To create a story in Tableau that showcases the demand level in each fulfillment center and provides a granular understanding of the performance of the center by including product information. The client wants an end-to-end report to identify which fulfillment areas are performing well and which ones are not, and to add nuance to the report, the analysis should also consider the center-meal combination.
